This repository contains data for manuscript: Finn, K. J., Bergman, J. C., & Lee-Yaw, J. A. (2024). Deciding where to put them: sensitivity tests and independent evaluation are critical when using species distribution models to inform conservation translocations.

Folder Descriptions

EnvironmentalVariables: Folder of the 9 environmental variables used to produce Species Distribution Models (SDMs) at their largest extent (long-toed salamander range. See SupMat of main manuscript for acronym definitions (available from: X) 

PredictionSurfaces: Sixteen SDMs (logistic output, .tif files) produced for long-toed salamanders using two different sets of environmental variables, two different types of background points, and four different study extents. 

PresenceData: Environmental information represented by long-toed salamander presence and target group background datasets at their largest extent (long-toed salamander range).  Spatial information has been redacted as per data sharing agreements. Contact Kaegan Finn (email provided above) if you wish to request spatial information.

Scripts: R Scripts used for all analyses presented in manuscript. Largely written by Jayna Bergman (co-author). 

Study Extents: Polygons (.shp files) of the four study extents used in this manuscript (Albers Equal Area Conic).
