PredictionSurfaces: Sixteen SDMs (logistic output, .tif files) produced for long-toed salamanders using two different sets of environmental variables, two different types of background points, and for different study extents. 

PresenceData: Environmental information represented by long-toed salamander presence and target group background datasets at their largest extent (long-toed salamander range).  Spatial information has been redacted as per data sharing agreements. Contact Kaegan Finn (email provided above) if you wish to request spatial information.

Scripts: R Scripts used for all analyses presented in manuscript. Largely written by Jayna Bergman (co-author).
